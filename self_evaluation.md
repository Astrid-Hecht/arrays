## Self eval

1. How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?
  * I'm feeling very confident. This is one of the subjects I remember best from my Java class and theres a ton of overlap

1. Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?
  * I don't think so, I already did some extra learning and got fancy with how my code detects the last array element. No matter how big the array, it'll always pull the correct value.

1. What questions do you have about Arrays?
  * I'm mostly curious about interesting use cases. My familiarity with them goes as far as using them directly, but I haven't had a lot of experience with how the breadth of their use in the industry.
